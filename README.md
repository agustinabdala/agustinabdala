AGUSTÍN HIPÓLITO ABDALA
SUMMARY

🎯 I’m an accomplished Engineering Manager, Tech & Dev Team Leader, Process Engineer, and Data Analyst, combining deep technical expertise with strategic business insight and team leadership.

Currently expanding my capabilities through the Data Engineering Professional Certificate, I focus on building robust, scalable, and insight-driven data solutions that power digital transformation, smart systems, and industrial automation.

My leadership spans Agile, SCRUM, Kanban, and Waterfall methodologies, delivering complex projects on time and within scope. I lead multidisciplinary teams, bridging the gap between developers, analysts, engineers, and stakeholders to turn business needs into high-impact technical outcomes.

I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and JavaScript, with a strong foundation in data visualization, machine learning, AI, and business intelligence tools. I work comfortably across platforms—Linux, Windows, macOS—and leverage modern tooling like Git, SQL, and ETL frameworks for seamless versioning, querying, and data operations.

✅ Known for being proactive, detail-oriented, and results-driven, I thrive in high-stakes environments where both technical excellence and cross-team collaboration are essential. I’m fluent in English (B2/C1) and communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences.
